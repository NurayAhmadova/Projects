# Environment variables
# If you go into your PyCharm project and you go into this tab where it says "Terminal", here if you type in env
# and hit "Enter", you can see a whole bunch of variables. So you've got a key and a value and in between
# there is just a single equal (=) sign. So these are the different variables that are set in the environment
# in which your code is run. These variables have values which are strings which can be used in
# our applications or our code. What exactly all these environment variables used for? Well,
# there's two major use cases.
# One is for convenience. Normally when you deploy a large application,
# the process is quite complicated. And once you've done it, you kind of don't want to mess around
# with the code base and update the code files like your main.py for example. Instead, you could have these
# environment variables, which you can change. For example, if you had an application that was sending you
# emails out to your clients, then your client base emails might change day to day. So certain variables that are
# being used in your code base could be set as environment variables and you can modify those
# variables without having to touch the code.
# A second reason might be for security. So when you're developing software, you might be uploading your code based
# somewhere, for example to store it online or to a service like PythonAnywhere. And it's usually not a good idea
# to have things like your authentication keys or your API keys to be stored in the same place as
# the rest of your code. That's where environment variables come in. So environment variables essentially allow
# us to separate out where we store our keys, our secret stuff, and various other variables away from where our code
# base is located. In our case, it doesn't really matter because we haven't got a paid account anywhere in here.
# It doesn't really matter if somebody steals our auth token or our API key, because none of those are linked to
# our payment details. Now, however, if we were to upgrade our accounts on open weather map's API or on Twilio's API,
# then we definitely want to keep these two things secret; auth token and the API key. Instead of having it located
# in the same place where we've got our code base which means you might accidentally upload it somewhere on
# the internet where other people can see it, instead, we can store these two things as environment variables.
# We can create an environment variable by simply typing export and then the name of the variable which I'll call
# OWM _API_KEY. And then it's really important that we have no spaces, but just a single equal sign.
# And then we're going to store everything that's in between the quotation marks.
